# NAND2TETRIS Hardware Simulation README

## Introduction

This README provides instructions for using the NAND2TETRIS hardware simulator to test hardware description language (HDL) files. The simulator allows you to load HDL files, run test scripts, and verify the functionality of digital circuits.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware Simulator**: Ensure you have the NAND2TETRIS hardware simulator installed on your system.
- **NAND2TETRIS Course Files**: You should have access to the course project files, specifically HDL files and test scripts.

## Files Included

- **HDL Files**: These files define the digital circuits.
  - `Not.hdl`: HDL file for the NOT gate circuit.
  - `Or.hdl`: HDL file for the OR gate circuit.

- **Test Scripts**: These files contain test cases for verifying the HDL files.
  - `Not.tst`: Test script for the NOT gate.
  - `Or.tst`: Test script for the OR gate.

## Steps to Test HDL Files

1. **Open the Hardware Simulator**
   - Launch the hardware simulator application.

2. **Load the HDL Chip**
   - Navigate to the folder containing your HDL files:
     ```
     nand2tetris -> Projects -> 01
     ```
   - Open the HDL file you want to test. For example:
     - `Not.hdl` for testing the NOT gate.
     - `Or.hdl` for testing the OR gate.

3. **Load the Test Script**
   - Navigate to the folder containing your test scripts:
     ```
     nand2tetris -> Projects -> 01
     ```
   - Open the corresponding test script:
     - `Not.tst` for the NOT gate.
     - `Or.tst` for the OR gate.

4. **Run the Code to Test the Output**
   - Click the "Run" or "Execute" button in the simulator to start the test script.
   - Observe the results displayed by the simulator to verify if the HDL circuit functions as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- **Simulation Errors**: If you encounter errors, double-check the syntax of your HDL files and test scripts. Refer to the NAND2TETRIS documentation for detailed information on correct syntax and error messages.
- **Unexpected Results**: Ensure that the HDL code accurately reflects the desired circuit behavior. Review the test script to confirm that it covers all expected scenarios.
